"""
Create Blue metadata from Red.
The thing is that blue and red fits files might have slightly different timestamps, so it is not enough just to change b and r in filenames.

Usage: obsdate and prefix!!!

This code only checks if Blue has more run numbers than red and prints the difference. Then you have to edit the header yourself. It is mostly just deletion.
