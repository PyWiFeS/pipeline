Directory Structure
===================

The pipeline generates a directory structure to store the **reduced data**. The directory structure is created within the working directory specified by the user. The working directory is the directory where the pipeline is executed. 

The pipeline will generate the `data_products` directory within the working directory `/.../working_directory` containing the reduced data, a logger file to track the information from the reduction process, and the following structure: 

- data_products
    - `pywifes_logger.log` 
    - `xxx-Blue-UTxxx.cube.fits`
    - `xxx-Red-UTxxx.cube.fits`
    - `xxx-Splice-UTxxx.cube.fits`
    - ... 
    - `xxx-Blue-UTxxx.spec.apx.fits`
    - `xxx-Red-UTxxx.spec.apx.fits`
    - `xxx-Splice-UTxxx.spec.apx.fits`
    
    - plots
        - `UTxxx_detection_plot.png`
        - `xxx-Blue-UTxxx_.spec.ap1.png`
        - `xxx-Red-UTxxx_.spec.ap1.png`
        - ...
        - `xxx-Splice-UTxxx_.spec.ap1.png`
        - ... 
        - blue
            - `bias.png`
            - `flat_response.png`
            - ...
        - red
            - `bias.png`
            - `flat_response.png`
            - ...

    - intermediate
        - blue
            - `xxx-Blue-UTxxx.p00.fits`
            - `xxx-Blue-UTxxx.p01.fits`
            - ...
            - `xxx-Blue-UTxxx.p10.fits`
        - red
            - `xxx-Red-UTxxx.p00.fits`
            - `xxx-Red-UTxxx.p01.fits`
            - ...
            - `xxx-Red-UTxxx.p10.fits`
        - raw_data_temp
            - `xxx-Blue-UTxxx.fits`
            - ...
            - `xxx-Red-UTxxx.fits`
            - ...

    - master_calib 
        - `wifes_blue_<master_calibration>_files.fits`
        - ...
        - `wifes_red_<master_calibration>_files.fits`
        - ...

`data_products` contains the `plots` directory with the final figures of the data reduction: the 2D extracted spectra, the spliced spectra, and the sources detection plots. The figures generated during the calibration steps are saved in a different directory for each arm (`data_products/plots/arm`). 
Then, the `data_products/intermediate` directory with the calibration files generated during the data reduction process and saves the data separately for each red and blue arm. Also in `intermediate` there is the temporary directory `raw_data_temp` aimed to store the raw data and any pre-treated images (e.g. cut down calibration frames to stellar mode size, when needed) during the data reduction process. `raw_data_temp` is automatically removed when the pipeline is successfully completed. 

Finally, we find `data_products/master_calib`, which is a directory with all master calibration files produced in the data reduction. They are stored to be used in further reductions if required.
