Splice the data
===============

Welcome to the documentation for the 'splice.py' module. This module is used to splice the data from the WiFeS spectrograph by combining the reduced data from the blue and red arms of the spectrograph. The module provides two main functions, `splice_spectra` and `splice_cubes`, which are used to splice the spectra and the cubes respectively.
