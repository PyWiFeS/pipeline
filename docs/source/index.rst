Welcome to the PyWiFeS User Manual!
===================================

PyWiFeS is an automated Python data reduction pipeline for the Wide Field Spectrograp (WiFeS).

An overview of the WiFeS instrument itself can be found on its `RSAA webpage <https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observatories/telescopes/wifes>`_.

PyWiFeS is designed to help astronomers and researchers to automatically reduce and analyze data from the WiFeS spectrograph. This pipeline automates all of the routine tasks involved in data reduction. It is written in Python and is open-source, allowing users to modify and extend the code to suit their needs.

This documentation will guide you through installation, usage, main features and general information of the pipeline, and will provide you details about the different modules available.
