Welcome to the PyWiFeS User Manual!
===================================

PyWiFeS is an automated Python data reduction pipeline for the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS). WiFeS is an optical integral field spectrograph for the ANU 2.3m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory.

An overview of the WiFeS instrument itself can be found on its `RSAA webpage <https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observatories/instruments/wide-field-spectrograph-wifes>`_.
WiFeS has a field of view of 25x38 arcseconds, with R=3000 VPH gratings that cover the full optical wavelength range in a single exposure, as well as R=7000 VPH gratings that offer higher spectral resolution for smaller wavelength ranges. 

WiFeS was described in two papers led by the Principal Investigator, the late Michael Dopita, in `2007 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Ap%26SS.310..255D/abstract>`_ and `2010 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Ap%26SS.327..245D/abstract>`_.

PyWiFeS is written in Python and is open-source, allowing users to modify and extend the code to suit their needs. PyWiFeS is compatible with data from the automated 2.3m telescope as well as the previous manual telescope operations through TAROS. The upgrade of the 2.3m for automated observations was described by `Price et al. (2024) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024PASA...41...57P/abstract>`_

The original version of PyWiFeS was described by `Childress et al. (2014) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Ap%26SS.349..617C/abstract>`_.
A publication describing PyWiFeS version 2 is in preparation.

Addition details are available in the `PyWiFeS User Manual <https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/pywifes/doku.php?id=documentation>`_. The manual explains the general structure of the pipeline, the steps of the data reduction, or technical details about the Python modules and functions.

The development of PyWiFeS version 2 was made possible by grant LE230100063 from the Australian Research Council.

This documentation will guide you through installation, usage, main features and general information of the pipeline, and will provide you details about the different modules available.
